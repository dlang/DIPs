## Rationale
Required.

A short motivation about the importance and benefits of the proposed change.  An existing,
well-known issue or a use case for an existing projects can greatly increase the
chances of the DIP being understood and carefully evaluated.

## Prior Work
Required.

If the proposed feature exists, or has been proposed, in other languages, this is the place
to provide the details of those implementations and proposals. Ditto for prior DIPs.

If there is no prior work to be found, it must be explicitly noted here.

## Description
Required.

Detailed technical description of the new semantics. Language grammar changes
(per https://dlang.org/spec/grammar.html) needed to support the new syntax
(or change) must be mentioned. Examples demonstrating the new semantics will
strengthen the proposal and should be considered mandatory.

## Breaking Changes and Deprecations
This section is not required if no breaking changes or deprecations are anticipated.

Provide a detailed analysis on how the proposed changes may affect existing
user code and a step-by-step explanation of the deprecation process which is
supposed to handle breakage in a non-intrusive manner. Changes that may break
user code and have no well-defined deprecation process have a minimal chance of
being approved.

## Reference
Optional links to reference material such as existing discussions, research papers
or any other supplementary materials.

## Reviews

of the DIP process beyond the Draft Review.
