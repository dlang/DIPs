## Abstract

Short and concise description of the idea in a few lines.

### Links

Optional sections containing links to existing discussions, research papers or any
other supplementary materials.

## Description

Detailed technical description of the new semantics.
Language grammar changes (per https://dlang.org/spec/grammar.html)
needed to support the new syntax (or change) must be mentioned.

### Rationale

State a short motivation about the importance and benefits of the proposed
change.  An existing, well-known issue or a use case for an existing projects
can greatly increase the chances of the DIP being understood and carefully
evaluated.

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

Provide a detailed analysis on how the proposed changes may affect existing
user code and a step-by-step explanation of the deprecation process which is
supposed to handle breakage in a non-intrusive manner. Changes that may break
user code and have no well-defined deprecation process have a minimal chance of
being approved.

### Examples

A more practical explanation of DIP semantics should be given by showing
several examples of its idiomatic application. Inspecting vivid code examples
is usually an easier & quicker way to evaluate the value of a proposal than
trying to reason about its abstract description.
