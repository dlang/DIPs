## Abstract

The word `body` is used in many day-to-day contexts that makes working around the
fact that it is a keyword in D tedious. Furthermore, this removal is very often
requested by various well known and lesser known D programmers. This DIP proposes that
the `body` keyword be removed and the word "body" be made available for use as the
name of a symbol. Various methods are put forward for either replacing or entirely
removing the role `body` currently serves in D's contract programming syntax.

This proposal assumes basic knowledge of the terms "keyword" and "symbol" in
relation to D.

## Description

The proposed changes to D are very simple, and are as follows:

1. Remove `body` as a keyword, or in the case of [Option 1](#option-1-contextual-keyword), implement `body` as a contextual keyword.
2. In the case of [Option 2](#option-2-allow-function-replace-body-after-deprecation) or [Option 3](#option-3-allow-omitting-body-then-remove-body-after-deprecation),
   the regular deprecation process for language features must be followed. Using `body` as a keyword will be deprecated, then optionally
   a warning will be added. Finally, `body` will be removed as a keyword.
3. Allow the usage of the word "body" as a symbol name.

#### Option 1: Conditional Keyword
Keep `body` as a contextual keyword and allow it as a sybol name in all other contexts. There will be no code breakage and
users will not have to adjust their code.  Therefore, this option has the easiest migration path and requires the least
amount of user effort. However, Walter Bright [strongly opposes](#walter-bright-on-contextual-keywords) contextual keywords and is unlikely to support their addition
to DMD on the basis that they will complicate the parser.

The grammar will not have to change if this option is implemented.

#### Option 2: Allow `function`, replace `body` after deprecation
Add `function` as an optional keyword in the place of `body` and schedule the `body` keyword for deprecation. After this
period allow `body` as a symbol name. This option will require some user effort to adjust their code and does not have
a migration path that is as easy as [Option 1](#option-1-contextual-keyword). However, it also does not require that contextual keywords be implemented.

The grammar will change as follows:
```
# This
BodyStatement:
    body BlockStatement

# Becomes this
BodyStatement:
    function BlockStatement
```

#### Option 3: Allow omitting `body`, then remove `body` after deprecation
Allow the function body to optionally be annotated with `body`, but do not require it. Schedule the `body` keyword for
deprecation. After this period, allow body as a symbol name. This option will require roughly the same amount of user
effort to adjust their code as [Option 2](#option-2-allow-function-replace-body-after-deprecation) and the migration path is also similar. It also does not require that
contextual keywords are implemented. Finally, as a keyword is not necessary to designate the body of a function,
this option will make the language more consistent in that function bodies never have to be annotated, whether they
have a contract or not. Finally, it has the advantage of reducing the cost of D's contract syntax by 1 line, assuming
that the `body` or `function` keyword is place on its own line ([example](#shorter-contracts)).

There are two ways to change the grammar to accomodate this feature:
```
# This
BodyStatement:
    body BlockStatement

# Becomes this
BodyStatement:
    BlockStatement
```

Or alternatively:

```
#This
FunctionLiteralBody:
    BlockStatement
    FunctionContractsopt BodyStatement

FunctionBody:
    BlockStatement
    FunctionContractsopt BodyStatement
    FunctionContracts

# Becomes this
FunctionLiteralBody:
    BlockStatement
    FunctionContractsopt BlockStatement

FunctionBody:
    BlockStatement
    FunctionContractsopt BlockStatement
    FunctionContracts
```

If the implementation of contextual keywords is rejected, the recommended option is [Option 3](#option-3-allow-omitting-body-then-remove-body-after-deprecation). [Option 2](#option-2-allow-function-replace-body-after-deprecation) is to be considered only if options 1
and 3 are rejected. This is because [Option 1](#option-1-contextual-keyword) requires no deprecation and will not break user code, and option 3 simplifies the language as
compared to option 2.

### Rationale

Many D programmers [complain](#forum-discussion) about `body` being a keyword in D. It is a commonly used
word in many different fields and as such, a programmer working in these fields will regularly come into contact with the
fact that it is a keyword (much to their annoyance). The `body` keyword in D does not "pull its weight"; D's contract programming
features are rarely used compared to how useful and desirable it is to be able to name a symbol "body". However, Even if D's
contract programming features _were_ heavily used, the author believes that it would not make up for the inconvenience caused by
`body` being a keyword. One of the reasons for this is that there is only **one** context in which body is used, compared to the
many different contexts in user code in which the word "body" may be used as a symbol name.

A partial list of the contexts in which the word `body` might be used as a symbol
name:

- In web programming where "body" is a required tag in any valid HTML document. Ex:
- It is a name commonly used for XML tags and/or attributes
- Physics simulations as well in astronomical contexts ("planetary bodyies", etc.)
- Video games, such as referring to the player character's body
- Working with HTTP requests and responses, which have a body
- Working programmatically with emails, which have a body
- Many external C and C++ libraries make use of "body" as a symbol name, making
  porting these to D and creating bindings for them more difficult
- Writing compilers and parsers (functions, loops, etc. all have bodies)
- Scripting interfaces and wrappers

Examples of game physics library code ported to D that use body as a symbol:

- [Example 1: dchip](https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/dchip/blob/55f43e5f0cf67c8bc190711b69eb16230fa6188e/src/dchip/cpBody.d#L184)
- [Example 2: dbox](https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/dbox/blob/6f81fe065abec1e7def44fc777c5d8e9da936104/examples/demo/tests/bodytypes.d#L103)
- [Example 3: chipmunkd](https://github.com/rcorre/chipmunkd/commit/d6bde5b649c70a53f4295f522e660fae3c1e740f)

The `body` keyword is not required from a parsing perspective; an un-annotated function block could be used
with no difficulties. Alternatively, the `function` keyword is readily available and has the same
meaning when used in the context of function contracts; it is very close in meaning to
the `body` keyword in this context. The `body` keyword is in fact shorthand for the term
"_function_ body", denoting the body of a function defintion that contains the actual code.
Therefore, these changes will not be any less descriptive of what the keyword means in
this context than the keyword `body`. It is anticipated that these changes may actually
lead to _less_ confusion for programmers that are new to D.

Also, the author believes that the `function` keyword is not as "overloaded" with different
meanings in different contexts, like with other keywords such as `static`. Therefore, these
proposed changes will not unduly "overload" the keyword `function`. There are currently 2
other contexts in which the `function` keyword is already used:

- Function variable type definitions
- Function literal definitions

Examples:
```D
int function(char c) fp; //Function variable type definition

fp = function int(char c) { return 6; }; //Function literal definition

int function() fp2 = function { return 0; }
```

If one considers that each keyword in a language entails a certain cost in terms of what names a
user may use as a symbol, as well as the fact that new users must learn what each keyword means,
then it follows that allowing `function` to be used in the context of function contracts has a much
"cheaper" tradeoff than using `body`. Therefore, it makes sense logically to remove the `body`
keyword, which has a high cost with a low return on investment, with the `function` keyword, which
also has a relatively high cost, but a much better return on investment.

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

If `body` becomes a contextual keyword, there will be no code breakage and no effort
required on the part of the user to change their code. Otherwise, there is the possibility
of widespread code breakage for options 1 and 2. This will be mitigated by a long deprecation
period of at least 2 years, giving users adequate time to update their code.

### Examples

#### How "body" might be used as a variable name in DOM-based code
```D
document.body.addEventListener("click"), (Event ev) { //Error, body is a keyword
    ev.target.appendText("got click!");
    ev.preventDefault();
});
```

#### How "body" Is Currently Used in Physics Simulation Code
```D
void cpBodyActivateStatic(cpBody* body_, cpShape* filter)
{
    cpAssertHard(cpBodyIsStatic(body_), "cpBodyActivateStatic() called on a non-static body_.");

    mixin(CP_BODY_FOREACH_ARBITER!("body_", "arb", q{
        if (!filter || filter == arb.a || filter == arb.b)
        {
            cpBodyActivate(arb.body_a == body_ ? arb.body_b : arb.body_a);
        }
    }));
}
```

#### Examples of How Code Will Change with This Proposal
[Option 1:](#option-1-contextual-keyword)
```D
//There is no change from how it is currently written in D
int div(int a, int b)
in { assert(b != 0); }
body
{
    return a / b;
}

auto div = function(int a, int b) in { assert(b != 0); } body { return a / b; };
```

[Option 2:](#option-2-allow-function-replace-body-after-deprecation)
```D
int div(int a, int b)
in { assert(b != 0); }
function
{
    return a / b;
}

auto div = function(int a, int b) in { assert(b != 0); } function { return a / b; };
```

[Option 3:](#option-3-allow-omitting-body-then-remove-body-after-deprecation)
```D
int div(int a, int b)
in { assert(b != 0); }
{
    return a / b;
}

auto div = function(int a, int b) in { assert(b != 0); } { return a / b; };
```

#### Shorter Contracts
```D
//This is typically how function contracts are written today
void sqrt(int n)
in
{
    assert(n >= 0);
}
out (result)
{
    assert(result * result == n)
}
body
{
    //Implementation
}

//Option 3 reduces the number of lines by 1
void sqrt(int n)
in
{
    assert(n >= 0);
}
out (result)
{
    assert(result * result == n);
}
{
    //Implementation
}
```
