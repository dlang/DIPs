## Abstract

The word `body` is used in many day-to-day contexts that makes working around
the fact that it is a keyword in D tedious. Furthermore, this removal is very
often requested by various well known and lesser known D programmers. This DIP
proposes that the `body` keyword be removed and the word "body" be made
available for use as the name of a symbol. Various methods are put forward for
either replacing or entirely removing the role `body` currently serves in D's
contract programming syntax.

This proposal assumes basic knowledge of the terms "keyword" and "symbol" in
relation to D.

## Description

The proposed changes to D are very simple, and are as follows:

1. Add `do` as an optional keyword in the place of `body`.
2. Temporarily make `body` a contextual keword that is only a keyword when marking the body of a function. In all other conexts `body` may be used as a symbol name.
3. Schedule the `body` keyword for deprecation.
4. Once the deprecation period has ended remove `body` as a keyword and only allow `do`.

These changes have a very simple migration path for user code while also allowing `body` to immediately be used as a symbol name. Making `body` a contextual keyword and deprecating it, while also allowing `do`, affords users plenty of time for code to be updated to use `do`. It also ensures that user code will not immediately be broken. Finally, it avoids any potential long-term problems with keeping body as a contextual keyword.

It is possible that using `do` to mark the function body may cause some confusion as to when `do` is referring to a function body or when it is referring to a loop body. However, the author does not believe that this is a concern; there are multiple keywords that risk causing similar confusion and yet, in practice, D users do not have trouble distinguishing which usage is intended within the surrounding context. One such example is the `if` template constraint syntax that looks identical to the regular `if`-statement syntax, save for the fact that it is only present after a template declaration.

The grammar will change as follows while either `body` or `do` are allowed:
```
# This
BodyStatement:
    body BlockStatement

# Becomes this
BodyStatement:
    body BlockStatement
    do BlockStatement
```

After `body` is deprecated and removed, the grammar will change as follows:
```
# This
BodyStatement:
    body BlockStatement
    do BlockStatement

# Becomes this
BodyStatement:
    do BlockStatement
```

Using the `do` keyword was suggested by [David Gileadi](http://forum.dlang.org/post/off8ag$3t5$1@digitalmars.com) and [Random D user](http://forum.dlang.org/post/rhuxwyotfctdfzxguatv@forum.dlang.org).

### Rationale

Many D programmers [complain](#forum-discussion) about `body` being a keyword in D. It is a commonly used word in many different fields and as such, a programmer working in these fields will regularly come into contact with the fact that it is a keyword (much to their annoyance).

Furthermore, D's contract programming features are rarely used compared to how
useful and desirable it is to be able to name a symbol "body". In the whole of
Phobos, there are fewer than 300 uses of the `body` keyword, which is very small compared to the library's total line count. However, even if D's contract
programming features _were_ heavily used, it would not compensate for the
inconvenience caused by `body` being a keyword. 

One of the reasons for this is
that there is only **one** context in which body is used, compared to the many
different contexts in user code in which the word "body" may be used as a symbol name. Therefore, this keyword does not "pull its weight" syntactically. This makes it very disruptive and annoying
when encountering such an issue in one's code.

A partial list of the contexts in which the word `body` might be used as a symbol name:

- In web programming where "body" is a required tag in any valid HTML document. Ex:
- It is a name commonly used for XML tags and/or attributes
- Physics simulations as well in astronomical contexts ("planetary bodies", etc.)
- Video games, such as referring to the player character's body
- Working with HTTP requests and responses, which have a body
- Working programmatically with emails, which have a body
- Many external C and C++ libraries make use of "body" as a symbol name, making
  porting these to D and creating bindings for them more difficult
- Writing compilers and parsers (functions, loops, etc. all have bodies)
- Scripting interfaces and wrappers

Examples of game physics library code ported to D that use body as a symbol:

- [Example 1: dchip](https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/dchip/blob/55f43e5f0cf67c8bc190711b69eb16230fa6188e/src/dchip/cpBody.d#L184)
- [Example 2: dbox](https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/dbox/blob/6f81fe065abec1e7def44fc777c5d8e9da936104/examples/demo/tests/bodytypes.d#L103)
- [Example 3: chipmunkd](https://github.com/rcorre/chipmunkd/commit/d6bde5b649c70a53f4295f522e660fae3c1e740f)

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

As previously discussed, user code will not immediately broken, save for if the user compiles their code with the `-de` copmiler flag. There will be some breakage once the deprecation period ends and `body` is removed entirely; the intent is to allow a deprecation period that is long enough that most users will be able to update their code to use `do`. This process could be accelerated by encouraging users to employ [dfix](https://github.com/dlang-community/dfix) to update their code.

### Examples

#### How "body" might be used as a variable name in DOM-based code
```D
document.body.addEventListener("click"), (Event ev) { //Error, body is a keyword
    ev.target.appendText("got click!");
    ev.preventDefault();
});
```

#### How "body" Is Currently Used in Physics Simulation Code
```D
void cpBodyActivateStatic(cpBody* body_, cpShape* filter)
{
    cpAssertHard(cpBodyIsStatic(body_), "cpBodyActivateStatic() called on a non-static body_.");

    mixin(CP_BODY_FOREACH_ARBITER!("body_", "arb", q{
        if (!filter || filter == arb.a || filter == arb.b)
        {
            cpBodyActivate(arb.body_a == body_ ? arb.body_b : arb.body_a);
        }
    }));
}
```

#### Examples of How Code Will Change with This Proposal

```D
int div(int a, int b)
in { assert(b != 0); }
do
{
    return a / b;
}

auto div = function(int a, int b) in { assert(b != 0); } do { return a / b; };

long fact(int n)
in { assert(n >= 0); }
do
{
    long factHelper(int count, long acc)
    out(result) { assert(result >= acc); }
    do
    {
        if (count == 0)
            return acc;
        else
            return factHelper(count - 1, count * acc);
    }
    
    return factHelper(n, 1);
}
```

### Reviews

This DIP was accepted by the language authors. They agree with the rationale put forth as justification
for the change and that using an existing keyword, specifically `do`, in place of `body` is a
reasonable solution. Although opposed to contextual keywords as a permanent part of the language, they
felt it acceptable to allow `body` to become a contextual keyword *temporarily* as the DIP
recommends. This will, upon implementation, allow the immediate usage of `body` for symbol names in
user code. `body` will be deprecated at the same time it is made contextual and, once the deprecation
cycle is complete, will be removed from the language.

See the [previous version](rclink) of this DIP for other implementation options that were proposed,
but rejected.
