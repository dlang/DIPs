## Rationale

Ref declarations are a restricted form of pointer declarations. They are restricted
in that:

1. they cannot reassigned after initialization
2. pointer arithmetic cannot be done on them
3. they cannot be copied, other than being used to initialize another ref

Decades of successful use have demonstrated the utility of this form of
restricted pointer. Ref declarations are a major tool for writing memory-safe code,
and self-documenting the restricted use of being a ref rather than a pointer.

Currently, ref declarations are only allowed for:

1. function parameters
2. function return values
3. declaration references to element types in a foreach statement

Of particular interest here is the success of item (3). There doesn't appear to
be a downside of using `ref` for such declarations, so by extension ordinary
local variables should also benefit from being declared as `ref`. Often I've run
across cases where declaring a local as `ref` rather than a pointer would have
made the code nicer and safer.

This DIP is for declaring local variables as `ref` and does not extend to globals, `static`s, `extern`s,
`__gshared`s, or fields.


## Prior Work

C++ allows variables to be declared as a reference rather than a pointer. The same
goes for `ref` struct field declarations, although that is not part of this proposal.

## Description

`ref` is already allowed in the grammar for variable declarations, it is disallowed
in the semantic pass.
https://dlang.org/spec/declaration.html#VarDeclarations
This proposal will "turn it on" so to speak, and its behavior will be the same as
the current behavior for assigning to function ref parameters.

Returning a `ref` variable from a function that returns a `ref` to a local stack variable is not allowed, i.e.
a `ref` cannot be assigned to a `ref` with a scope that exceeds the scope of the source.

```d
ref int dark(ref int x, int i, int* q)
{
    ref m = *q;    // m refers to whatever q points to

    ref j = i;     // j now points to i
    j = 3;         // now i is 3 as well

    auto k = j;    // k is an int with value 3
    auto p = &j;   // p is a pointer to i

    ref int y = x; // ok
    if (i)
        return x;  // ok
    else
        return y;  // nope
}
```

An example showing the utility of `ref`. This is from the DMD code generator:
```d
void pop87(int line, const(char)* file)
{
    if (NDPP)
        printf("pop87(%s(%d): stackused=%d)\n", file, line, global87.stackused);

    --global87.stackused;
    assert(global87.stackused >= 0);
    foreach (i; 0 .. global87.stack.length - 1)
        global87.stack[i] = global87.stack[i + 1];
    // end of stack is nothing
    global87.stack[$ - 1] = NDP();
}
```

becomes:

```d
void pop87(int line, const(char)* file)
{
    ref g = global87;
    if (NDPP)
        printf("pop87(%s(%d): stackused=%d)\n", file, line, g.stackused);

    --g.stackused;
    assert(g.stackused >= 0);
    foreach (i; 0 .. g.stack.length - 1)
        g.stack[i] = g.stack[i + 1];
    // end of stack is nothing
    g.stack[$ - 1] = NDP();
}
```

which reduces the complexity of the code, as long-winded global names get a shorthand.


C++ rvalue references are not part of this proposal.

## History

This DIP underwent two rounds of community feedback in the DIP development forum:

Feedback on the first draft:
https://forum.dlang.org/post/uvc6dq$2jjn$1@digitalmars.com

Feedback on the second draft:
https://forum.dlang.org/post/v11mh1$fvs$1@digitalmars.com

Given that the DIP author is one of the language maintainers, it was presented at a D Language Foundation meeting to determine if there were any objections to submitting it to the other language maintainer, Átila Neves, for approval. No objections were raised. In addition to the DIP author, the following people were present for that portion of the meeting:

Jonathan M. Davis,
Timon Gehr,
Martin Kinkelin,
Dennis Korpel,
Mathias Lang,
Mike Parker,
Robert Schadek,
Steven Schveighoffer, and
Adam Wilson

Átila reviewed the DIP and approved it after asking for a clarification. He agrees with the DIP's rationale that ref declarations are a major tool for writing memory-safe code and believes that aligns with our overarching goal of enhancing memory safety.
