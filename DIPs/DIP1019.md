## Abstract

This document proposes an approach to allowing named arguments, i.e. the annotation of function arguments with the corresponding parameter names, in the D programming language. Naming arguments can clarify an argument's intended purpose and improve code readability.

### Reference

Various solutions have been suggested in the D forums at  [1](https://forum.dlang.org/post/khcalesvxwdaqnzaqotb@forum.dlang.org) and [2](https://forum.dlang.org/post/n8024o$dlj$1@digitalmars.com).

Several library solutions have been attempted. See [1](https://forum.dlang.org/post/awjuoemsnmxbfgzhgkgx@forum.dlang.org) and [2](https://github.com/CyberShadow/ae/blob/master/utils/meta/args.d).

Another proposal has been put forth concurrently by
[rikkimax](https://github.com/rikkimax/DIPs/blob/named_args/DIPs/DIP1xxx-RC.md).

There is also an inactive proposal in [DIP88](https://wiki.dlang.org/DIP88).

## Rationale
Named arguments can be found as a language feature in several common programming
languages, e.g. Python's [keyword arguments](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments)),
Lua's [named arguments](https://www.lua.org/pil/5.3.html), and Swift's [argument labels](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html).

The motivation of this DIP is primarily to improve readability. The proposal does not address all
possibilities that are opened by the implementation of named arguments as found in other languages.
However, this DIP does not preclude such features from being implemented in a future extension of
the language.

Consider the following example of a function invocation in D:

```d
DecimalNumber product = CalculateProduct(values, 7, false, null);
```

It is difficult to decipher the meaning of each argument. Though some readers may intuit the meaning
of `values` or `7`, there is no way to know at the call site what `false` or `null` refer to.
One must consult the function's documentation. This is a real problem for which even Google's
C++ coding style guide provides a solution in the form of [using comments to annotate the
arguments](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Function_Argument_Comments), an approach the DIP author finds insufficient (and which is addressed later in this proposal).

In addition, this proposal has the added benefit of protecting against silent breakage in cases when
a function's parameters are repurposed and renamed. For example:

```d
// Old API: void drawRect(int x, int y, int width, int height);
// New API:
void drawRect(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1);
```

Here, the old implementation of `drawRect` interprets `x` and `y` as the top left
corner of a rectangle, and `width` and `height` as its dimensions. The new `drawRect` instead
interprets the arguments as the coordinates of the top left and the bottom right corners of the
rectangle. Without named arguments, old code will still compile because the types of the arguments
did not change even though the parameters will be interpreted differently, thereby causing silent
breakage.

## Description
In function calls, allow a function's arguments to be _optionally_ annotated with a label matching the corresponding parameter name, like this:

```d
void drawRect(int x, int y, int width, int height);

drawRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 1, height: 1);

drawRect(0, 0, width: 1, height: 1); // Also valid
```

When the label and the corresponding parameter name mismatch, the compiler will generate an
error of the following nature: "None of the forward declarations of function
drawRect(int, int, int, int) matches the argument names used to call it." The
relevance of forward declarations will become clear later. The inclusion of the
function prototype is to clarify the function overload chosen by overload resolution.

The compiler can go one step further and guess the intended forward declaration the
user is trying to call, and suggest possible corrections.

### Interaction with other language features

#### Ordering of arguments
Named arguments proposed by this DIP have no effect on the ordering of arguments in function calls.

#### Default parameters
Named arguments proposed by this DIP do not allow default parameters to be skipped..

#### Variadic functions
Variadic arguments can be labeled with the name of the variadic parameter and a subscript.

Example:

```d
void vfun(Args...)(int a, Args args);
void vfun2(Args...)(Args args, int a);

vfun(a: 1, args[0]: 1.0, args[1]: 'c');
vfun2!(string, char)(args[0]: "string", args[1]: 'c', a: 1);
```

#### Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS)
Named arguments are allowed in functions called via UFCS just as they are for the normal function call syntax.

```d
void fun(int a, int b, int c);

a.fun(b: 1, c: 2); // lowered to vfun(a, b:1, c:2);
```

#### Parameter name omission
If a function is defined with some of its parameter names omitted, arguments to those parameters can labeled with an empty name.

```d
void fun(int);

fun(:10);
```

#### Member function overrides
Overridden member functions can be called with a set of names matching any of the function
definitions which are visible through the object used to call those functions.

```d
class A {
    int a(int x);
}

class B : A {
    override int a(int z);
}

auto b = new B;
A a = cast(A)b;

b.a(z: 1); // valid
b.a(x: 1); // valid
a.a(x: 1); // valid
a.a(z: 1); // error
```

### Parameter name lock-in
This seems to be the biggest concern among people who are against named arguments. It is perceived
that once named arguments are applied in a function invocation, there will be no way to change
function parameter names without causing breakage.

As suggested in the rationale, such breakage can be desired when the function parameters have been
not just renamed, but repurposed. Not all name refactorings correspond with repurposing, so it is
useful to allow for such circumstances when breakage is undesirable. This DIP supplies one tool
toward that end.

**Allow calling the same function with a different set of parameter names:** This is achieved through the
use of one or more forward declarations of the function with a different set of parameter names. The caller can use names matching
those in the parameter list of any of the forward declarations. For example:

```d
int add(int c, int d);
int add(int b, int a) { ... }
void main() {
    add(b: 1, a: 1);  // fine
    add(c: 0, d: 10); // fine
    add(x: 1, b: 1);  // error, name mismatch with all candidates
}

```

With this, backward compatibility can be maintained after changing parameter names by keeping the
old prototype around as a forward declaration.

Forward declarations can be annotated with `deprecated` to indicate that a
certain set of parameter names are deprecated.

### Overloading and name mangling
Named arguments have no impact on function overloading. The argument name check is
only performed _after_ function overload resolution.

```d
int add(int a, int b) {...}
int add(int c, int d) {...}
void main() {
    add(a: 1, b: 2); // Error: `example.add` called with argument types `(int, int)` matches both
}
```

The compiler should generate a more useful error message in this case; it should at
least inform the user that named arguments play no role in function overloading.

Named arguments also don not participate in name mangling.

## Alternatives
There are several alternative ways to implement named arguments or a similar feature.
However, they generally add noise to function calls and/or require fundamental changes to how functions are defined.

For example, in one potential library-only solution, it is necessary to call functions like so:

```d
args!(add, a=>1, b=>1);
```

This has too much noise and does not allow for the use of Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS).

Also, this solution limits the name of variables that may be used as arguments.

```d
args!(add, a=>a, b=>b); // `a` and `b` refers to the lambda parameter, not variables defined in outer scope
```

Another solution, as employed by the Google style guide, is to use inline comments as argument labels:

```d
add(/* a */ 1, /* b */ 2);
```

Such comments add noise in the form of the opening `/*` and closing `*/`, which arguably
decrease readability. Moreover, this approach does not allow for unordered arguments and the
compiler cannot guarantee that parameters of the same (or implicitly convertible) type are
actually being called in the expected order, e.g. `b, a` as opposed to `a, b`.

## Future changes
This DIP does not prohibit future proposals for adding parameter reordering,
partially-specified parameter names with reordering, named template parameters,
omission of default arguments by using named arguments,
and other similar things. Nor does it prohibit the inclusion of parameter
names as part of mangled function names.

## Breaking Changes and Deprecations
No breaking changes are expected.

## Reviews

### Community Review Round 1

[Reviewed Version](https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/23ef47a94e0fdd5ddc4b2f6b2f4dcfd3c1f43aa6/DIPs/DIP1019.md)

[Discussion](https://forum.dlang.org/post/luxftbhbrgpzbzvbmrji@forum.dlang.org)

The DIP's requirement for a new function attribute, making named arguments opt-in for both the caller (using named arguments) and the callee (allowing named arguments on a given function) drew criticism: it would be confusing to new users if named arguments work for some functions but not all; it would be a hassle for developers to update old code to support named arguments; adding yet another function attribute is objectionable.

The DIP author insisted that it must be opt-in for the caller to "be robust against name changes" and for the callee because they have to choose if they want the extra responsibility of maintaining parameter names. He ultimately suggested that it should be possible to implement a template in Phobos that can automatically wrap non-`@named` functions to make them `@named`. As an alternative, he suggested relaxing the requirement that only `@named` functions can be called with named arguments: they can be used with non-`@named` functions and produce a warning on mismatch rather than an error.

One reviewer suggested simply allowing named arguments without requiring a new function attribute and allowing optional arguments to not be specified when one wants the default value, saying this would be easier to implement and easier to remove or improve as needed.

One reviewer asked how the example error message could be generated as written, given that the compiler can't know which parameter a named argument is intended to match if reordering is supported.

One reviewer suggested the DIP should provide more details about what sort of breakage the new function attribute would prevent.

One reviewer cited Dart as an example of a language that requires opt-in on the callee side for named arguments: when enabled, the name *must* be used in function calls; mixing optional arguments and named arguments is prohibited.

Some reviewers disliked the provision allowing for argument reordering. There was much discussion about the pros and cons. Eventually, the DIP author decided to remove this from the DIP.

A library solution, [kwargs](https://github.com/atilaneves/kwargs), was suggested, and considerable debate was had about the pros and cons.

One reviewer noted the [Rationale](#rationale) describes two issues that can arise without named arguments, but fails to address how named arguments can prevent them.

It was noted that the DIP mentions UFCS as an argument against a library solution, but does not address how it should work with named arguments. The DIP author said he would address this in the next revision.

Multiple reviewers mentioned that the DIP does not address how named arguments interact with default arguments. The DIP author suggested that a prefix of the parameters could be required, and that given the funciton `int fun(int a, int b = 1, int c = 2, int d = 3)`, users could specify `a`, `a, b`, `a, b, c`, or all of the parameters in any order. The response to this was that if skipping optional arguments would not be allowed, then argument reordering should be forbidden or left for a future DIP.

One reviewer suggested the DIP should address how named arguments behave with implicit template instantiation. The DIP author felt it should just work, but promised to give the idea consideration when revising the DIP.

One reviewer suggested the feature could be implemented via Tuples.

One reviewer pointed out that if an existing proposal to enhance struct initialization is accepted, then named arguments will be supported implicitly and would be preferably to a new attribute.

One reviewer objected that this is a cosmetic change that adds no meaningful benefit to the language. He noted that most languages that support named arguments are scripting languages where they are useful (such as in a REPL), but in a systems language it's self-documenting to use a struct instead.
