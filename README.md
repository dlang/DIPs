# D Improvement Proposals
This repository is intended for the storage and management of improvement proposals for the D programming language. A D Improvement Proposal (DIP) is a formal document that details a potential feature or enhancement to the language, or the official tooling, and the rationale behind it.

Each DIP is steered through a process of public review by the DIP manager. Each stage of the process is intended to prepare the DIP for its ultimate evaluation by the language maintainers (Walter Bright and Átila Neves). The process and the responsibilities of DIP authors and reviewers are laid out in the following documents:

* [The DIP Authoring Process](./docs/process-authoring.md)
* [The DIP Review Process](./docs/process-reviews.md)
* [DIP Author Guidelines](./docs/guidelines-authors.md)
* [DIP Reviewer Guidelines](./docs/guidelines-reviewers.md)

Questions about the DIP process should be directed to the current DIP Manager, Mike Parker (aldacron@gmail.com). The following lists show DIPs that have been submitted in the current process and DIPs that were approved before this repository existed:

* [currently submitted DIPs](https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/README.md)
* [older approved DIPs](https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/archive/README.md)
