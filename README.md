# D Improvement Proposals
This repository is intended for the storage and management of improvement proposals for the D programming language. A D Improvement Proposal (DIP) is a formal document that details a potential feature or enhancement to the language, or the official tooling, and the rationale behind it.

Each DIP is steered through a process of public review by the DIP manager. Each stage of the process is intended to prepare the DIP for its ultimate evaluation by the language maintainers (Walter Bright and √Åtila Neves). The process and the responsibilities of DIP authors and reviewers are laid out in the following documents:

* [The DIP Authoring Process](./docs/process-authoring.md)
* [The DIP Review Process](./docs/process-reviews.md)
* [DIP Author Guidelines](./docs/guidelines-authors.md)

Questions about the DIP process should be directed to the current DIP Manager, Mike Parker (aldacron@gmail.com). The following lists show DIPs that have been submitted in the current process and DIPs that were approved before this repository existed:

* [currently submitted DIPs](https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/README.md)
* [older approved DIPs](https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/archive/README.md)
